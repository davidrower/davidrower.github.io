  <h3><b>I'm a classical nerd.</b></h3>
  <p class="lead">Along with my physics, I've
    always enjoyed music. I've played piano most of my life,
    and cello for a little less time. At the beginning of undergrad, I
    assembled a casual string quartet to play through some standard repertoire
    (we got stuck on Borodin and Mendelssohn). Recently, I have been doing
    the same with the piano trio repertoire (currently my favorite chamber
    ensemble, stuck on Schubert and Mendelssohn).
  </p>
  <p class="lead">I'm a big Western music history nerd as well.
    In case you need a fun fact, here's a gem: Tchaikovsky wrote an elegy trio to Nikolai Rubinstein,
    and Rachmaninoff wrote an elegy trio to Tchaikovsky, but there's an obscure and sparsely
    recorded Russian composer, Alexander
    Goldenweiser, who wrote an elegy trio for Rachmaninoff, completing the tragic
    trio of elegy trios. I wouldn't be surprised if this goes deeper as well.</p>
  <p class="lead">I have more Rachmaninoff days than anything else. I've also been
    stuck on Medtner this past year.

  <h3><b>Beyond classical.</b></h3>
  <p class="lead">At some point, I tried to get familiar with jazz charts.

  <h3><b>Electronic.</b></h3>
  <p class="lead">Inspired by a friend, I got into analog synthesizers for a bit,
    and dropped too much money making a little eurorack rig. One of my long-term
    goals is to get proficient with Ableton - here is one of my first attempts
    at making something.
