  <h3><b>I love music!</b></h3>
  <p class="lead">Along with my physics, I've
    always enjoyed music. The most formative music for me was western classical, which ran in my family at the 
    professional level through grandparents I never had the chance to meet. 
    I grew up with classical piano training, and played cello starting a little later and without private lessons. </p>
    
  <p class="lead">Orchestras through undergrad and college eventually inspired me to assemble
    a casual chamber ensemble to play through whatever bits of the standard repertoire I could manage as a cellist.
    I was lucky enough to meet a pianist to entertain my casual chamber needs, and realized my favorite chamber ensemble - the piano trio.
    I'm now a fan of finding others to play chamber music with wherever I go! If this is you, please reach out :)
  </p>
  <p class="lead">Along with the playing and listening, I have always had a pet interest in western classical music history. 
    I took a few courses in undergrad, and you can still catch me reading biographies of my favorite pianists, composers, etc.</p>
  <p class="lead">My current favorite composer is Robert Schummann, for his piano works...it helps that he wrote <a target="_blank" id="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBYPPoUhkHE">a suite of dances for me</a>.</p>

  <p class="lead">Being around talented jazz musicians in college got me to fall for jazz piano - and it is now one of my lifetime goals to learn how to play jazz.
    When I started to get into it, I found slow ballads appealing - here's me attempting a sight read of
    <i>Pure Imagination</i>.</p>

  <p class="lead">I also had the priviledge of living with a bedroom producer in undergrad, which got me into electronic music (...especially future bass). Inspired by him and another friend who was into analog synthesizers,
    I got a subscription to ableton and made my own little eurorack rig. In short, another long-term music goal of mine is to get proficient with Ableton - here is one of my first attempts at making something.
