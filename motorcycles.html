    <p class="lead">Once upon a time, my brother and I got bored, and enrolled in MSF.
      At the beginning of his undergraduate junior year, he bought his first two motorcycles.
      This inspired me. I got a job, saved up some money, and bought my first
      bike, a 1989 Honda Hawk GT 650, during that spring break.</p>

        <p class="lead">Such a fun bike. Very glad I chose this as my first
          (sophomore year spring break). It is forgiving yet not too limiting,
          making it a nice bike to help develop my skills as a new rider. I've
          learned plenty on it, and have come to love it as a versatile
          around-town bike, which also doesn't just leave me stranded in
          Santa Barbara. The bike is a little rough around the edges, but it
          runs well besides some burning oil...</p>

        <p class="lead">My brother's first bike. My door to basic motorcycle
          maintenence and modifications. With some guidance from my brother,
          and some help from my friend James, I am looking to make this thing
          a ridiculous project. So far, I swapped the OEM handlebar for a drag
          bar, relocated the ignition off of the dash (to behind/below the seat),
          machined my own dash part, and had my brother cut off the mufflers
          with a dremmel tool...I was young then.</p>

        <p class="lead">Bought this on the first day of my 12 week stay in
          Santa Fe, New Mexico. Quite a fun ride, as I don't think I would
          ride this sort of bike had it not been the best option on craigslist
          at the time. It was fatter and has a louder personality than what I
          was used to...letting me fit right in with all the cruisers in the
          desert. I ended up losing $300 on it, not bad for a summer of riding!
          At the time, I thought down on how it felt more like an underpowered
          couch than a badass cruiser, but I actually miss the cozy and forgiving
          character of the bike now.</p>

        <p class="lead">Admittedly, my brother owned one before me, so I knew
          more or less what I was getting myself into. The impetus: he let me
          ride it (before I owned any bike of my own) - it was awesome, mean,
          overloaded with power, and left a great impression. Until I dropped
          it while making a u-turn at the end of the street. That is when I
          decided I needed my own bikes to really learn how to ride. From the
          Hawk to the Superhawk, I have felt large improvements in my riding,
          and look forward to keep growing my skills as a rider and hobbyist.</p>
